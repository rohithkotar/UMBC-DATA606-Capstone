## Background


## Description of Data Sources

The data used for this project is sourced from the [Crash Reporting Drivers Data](https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Public-Safety/Crash-Reporting-Drivers-Data/mmzv-x632/about_data) dataset provided by Montgomery County, Maryland. This dataset contains information about traffic accidents, including details such as the ACRS report number, crash date/time, road conditions, vehicle information, and injury severity.

## Data Elements

Below is a description of the key data elements/features used in the analysis:

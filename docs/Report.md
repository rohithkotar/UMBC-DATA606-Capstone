## Background


## Description of Data Sources

The data used for this project is sourced from the [Crash Reporting Drivers Data](https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Public-Safety/Crash-Reporting-Drivers-Data/mmzv-x632/about_data) dataset provided by Montgomery County, Maryland. This dataset contains information about traffic accidents, including details such as the ACRS report number, crash date/time, road conditions, vehicle information, and injury severity.

## Data Elements

Below is a description of the key data elements/features used in the analysis:

| Column Name | Description | Type |
|-------------|-------------|------|
| ACRS Report Type | Identifies crash as property, injury, or fatal. | Plain Text |
| Crash Date/Time | Date and Time of crash. | Date & Time |
| Route Type | Type of roadway at crash location. | Plain Text |
| Road Name | Name of road. | Plain Text |
| Cross-Street Type | Roadway type for nearest cross-street. | Plain Text |
| Collision Type | Type of collision. | Plain Text |
| Surface Condition | Condition of roadway surface. | Plain Text |
| Light | Lighting conditions. | Plain Text |

## Background

- **Objective**: This project aims to develop a robust predictive modeling approach for estimating injury severity in accidents using an unbalanced dataset.
- **Significance**:
   - Accurate prediction of injury severity can lead to more efficient resource allocation in emergency response systems, potentially saving lives by ensuring            timely and appropriate medical attention.
    - Improved injury severity prediction can aid in the development of proactive measures for accident prevention, contributing to overall public safety and             reducing the occurrence of severe accidents.
    - Enhanced understanding of factors contributing to injury severity can inform policy decisions and interventions aimed at reducing the societal and economic         burden associated with accidents and their aftermath.
    - Reliable injury severity prediction models can facilitate the development of personalized treatment plans for accident victims, optimizing healthcare               resources and improving patient outcomes.
    - The insights gained from this research can have broader implications beyond accident-related injuries, potentially informing predictive modeling efforts in         other domains with imbalanced datasets, such as healthcare and finance.

- **Research Questions**: 
  - How can we effectively address class imbalance in the dataset during the process of injury severity prediction?
  - Which machine learning algorithms demonstrate superior performance in predicting injury severity within unbalanced datasets?
  - Are there any trade-offs between model performance and computational efficiency when using sampling versus non-sampling approaches?
- **Additional Considerations**: 
  - In this study, various sampling methods, including oversampling and undersampling techniques, will be explored to mitigate class imbalance within the dataset.
  - Comparative analysis will be conducted by training predictive models both with and without sampling methods to discern their impact on predictive accuracy.

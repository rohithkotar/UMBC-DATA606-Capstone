## Background

- **What is it about?**: This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the severity of injuries in accidents using an unbalanced dataset.
- **Why does it matter?**: Predicting injury severity accurately can help emergency responders and healthcare providers allocate appropriate resources and prioritize treatment for accident victims.
- **Research Questions**: 
  - How can we effectively handle class imbalance in the dataset when predicting injury severity?
  - Which machine learning algorithms perform best for injury severity prediction in unbalanced datasets?
